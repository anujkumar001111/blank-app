of subscribers. The reality? Only 0.1% ever reach that milestone. But here's the
secret: it's not about luck—it's about strategy, consistency, and understanding
the platform.

• Design a professional logo and banner
• Write a compelling "About" section with keywords
• Set up channel sections to organize content

🎥 EQUIPMENT BASICS
